* Deployable interface (GUI/API) that (locally) orchestrates multiple (remote and/or local) Language Models.
* Python code is executed and tested against assertions; via configurable allow/block list of operations (regex).

Try it yourself:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git python3 python3-venv && python3 -m venv conductor_venv && source conductor_venv/bin/activate && pip3 install gradio openai GitPython && git clone https://github.com/rabbidave/conductor.git && cd conductor && python3 app.py
```

## Features

* **Multi LM Interaction:** Engage with multiple LMs sequentially for mob-style programming; w/ configurable exit criteria
* **Localized Code Execution:** Deploy wherever you want code executed via blocks with language specifiers e.g. ```python
* **Automated Test Execution:** Tests are automatically detected and executed from code blocks e.g. ```python-test
* **Test-Driven Generation:** Generation stops after a configurable number of successful tests and criteria have passed
* **Configurable IDs, APIs, and Parameters:** Easily switch between different URLs/LMs and Generation Settings
* **Dynamic Environment Configuration:** Modify model IDs, API URLs, maximum tokens, temperature, and top-p via the UI or `.env` file
* **Detailed Logging:** Comprehensive and configurable logs available in the `logs/` directory for debugging
* **Model Aliases:** Model Aliases allow you to set up the interaction with two distinct models or two instances of the same model

## Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+:** Ensure you have Python 3.7 or a newer version installed

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies (gradio, openai, GitPython) & Start the Interface:**
```bash
python app.py
```

2. **Access the UI:**
   * Open `http://localhost:31337` in your browser

3. **Interact with the LMs:**
   * Enter your prompt in "Input Message" textbox
   * Code blocks are automatically executed:
     * ```python for regular code
     * ```python-test for test assertions
   * Tests must pass for generation to complete
   * Use "Stop Generation" to halt manually
   * Use "Clear Conversation" to start fresh
   * "Show Last Code" and "Show Last Output" display recent executions

## Example

1. **Prompt:**
```
Create a function that calculates the square of a number and test it.
```

2. **Model Response:**
```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

print(square(5))  # Test output
```

```python-test
assert square(0) == 0, "Square of 0 should be 0"
assert square(5) == 25, "Square of 5 should be 25"
assert square(-2) == 4, "Square of -2 should be 4"
```

## Security Note
* Always use caution with code generated by an LLM
* Code execution is sandboxed with configurable allow/block lists
* Do not execute code from untrusted sources
