# conductor
Conductor is a deployable interactive workbench (soon API) that locally orchestrates multiple local Large Language Models (LLMs) with Python code execution and test assertion capabilities. It leverages Git (or a basic line-by-line diff if Git is not available) to track code changes, providing Aider-style diffs for easy review and integration.
